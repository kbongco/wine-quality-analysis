Project Background: 

Wine has been around for a long time! It is a drink that most people come to enjoy while pairing it with a good steak or just something to enjoy while watching some Netflix on a Wednesday night. Wine is made through the process of fermentation with the sugars in any type of fruit juice. While wine can be made with any type of fruit, grapes are mostly used due to the amount of fermentable sugar grapes have.

The food and beverage industry is a huge industry anywhere. The wine market is a huge industry and it is estimated to be about 39.8 billion dollars in the US. Thanks to the power and popularity of data science and its applications, a company can make use of the data they find to stay ahead of their competition or even to automate some of the smaller processes in the product development process. 

This is a small project of how data science can aid the wine business.
